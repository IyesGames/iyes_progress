---

This crate helps you in cases where you need to track when a bunch of
work has been completed, and perform a state transition.

The most typical use case are loading screens, where you might need to
load assets, prepare the game world, etcâ€¦ and then transition to the
in-game state when everything is done.

You can have any number of systems doing different things during
your loading state, and they can report their progress to this crate.

See the [example](./examples/full.rs) for an overview of how to use this crate.

---

There is also an optional feature (`assets`) implementing basic asset
loading tracking. Just add your handles to the `AssetsLoading` resource.

If you need something more advanced, I recommend the `bevy_asset_loader`
crate, which can integrate with this crate. :)
